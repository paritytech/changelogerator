# Changelog-erator :)

This utility is written in Ruby. It uses the [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit) gem to:
- connect to Github
- retrieve the list of changes between 2 references

While `0.x` versions were rather specific to the [Polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot) repository, those limitations have been removed starting with `0.9.x` versions.

The only requirement if you want to benefit from filtering labels in a better way that just comparing label names if to name your labels using the following generic pattern as see [here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/labels):

`<letter><number(s)>[-<arbitrary text>]`

For instance:

- `B0-Silent üòé`
- `C1-Important ‚ùóÔ∏è`
- `Z12`

Each of your issues or PR can have any number of labels. Advanced rules for labels can be defined and enforced using [ruled_labels](https://github.com/chevdor/ruled_labels).

Running `changelogerator` will fetch all the changes for a given repository from Github. You should set a value for the ENV `GITHUB_TOKEN` if you want to avoid being rate limited.

The produce json will be formatted as:
```
{
    "cl": {
        "meta": {
            "C": {
                "min": 3,
                "max": 9,
                "count": 3
            }, ...
        },
        "repository" : {
            "id" : 42,
            "node_id" : "...",
            "name" : "polkadot",
            ...
        },
        "changes": [
            {
                "meta": {
                    "C": {
                        "value": 7
                    },
                    "D": { "value": 8 }
                },
                ... Github information ...
                "number": 1234,
                ... way more information about the commit
                ... coming from Github
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The produced json output can then easily reprocessed into a beautiful changelog using tools such as [`tera`](https://github.com/chevdor/tera-cli).

## Testing

Some of the tests fetch data from GitHub. In case you do not have a
`$GITHUB_TOKEN` or simply do not wish to run them, set `GITHUB_TOKEN=disabled`
in your environment variables.

## Usage

You can check out the [tests](./test) to see it in action or query the help:

```
$ changelogerator --help

  Changelogerator helps you generate a template friendly context made of the changes
  between 2 references on your Github project.

  Usage:
  changelogerator [options]
    -v, --[no-]verbose               Run verbosely
    -f, --from=FROM                  From Ref.
    -t, --to=TO                      To Ref.
    -p, --[no-]prefix                Add (or not) a prefix for the repo
    -h, --help                       Prints this help
```

The key point to generate a custom changelog is to **slurp** all the json you need into a single one that can then be passed as context to your favorite templating engine.

Here is an example:

```
jq \
    --slurpfile foo.json \
    --slurpfile bar.json \
    -n '{
        foo: $foo[0],
        bar: $bar[0],
        foobar: [
            { age: 12 },
            { name: "bob" }
        ] }' | tee context.json
```

## Dev notes

- install: `bundle install`
- test: `rake test` (some of the test appear to be UN responding for a good minute, see how to set `GITHUB_TOKEN` above to speed things up)
- linting/formatting: `rubocop`
